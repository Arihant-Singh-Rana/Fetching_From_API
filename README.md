# React Product Display By Fetching From an API

## Overview
This React application fetches and displays product information from a dummy JSON API. It uses Axios for making HTTP requests and renders product cards with images, titles, descriptions, and prices.

## Installation
To run the app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the app:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage
Once the app is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the product display. The application fetches data from the [dummy JSON API](https://dummyjson.com/products) and displays the first 15 products.

## Code Snippet
Here's a snippet from the main React component (`App.js`):

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import axios from "axios";
import "./App.css";

export default function App() {
  const [data, setData] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    async function fetchData() {
      const response = await axios.get("https://dummyjson.com/products");
      setData(response.data.products);
    }
    fetchData();
  }, []);

  // Rest of the component code for rendering product cards...

  return <div className="parent">{show}</div>;
}
```
